# Objective #
Explore and analyze the history of every Lego brick provided by Rebrickable, using Python, along with the Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy libraries, providing insights into the evolution and variety of Lego sets over time.
# Packages #
For this project I used Python along with two libraries: Pandas and Matplotlib. Pandas helped me load and transform the dataset from Rebrickable into a dataframe, the dataset was in CSV format. From there, I used Matplotlib to visualize the data and better understand the information.
